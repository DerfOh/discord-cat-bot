## About
cat-bot is a simple bot for posting random cat images to a discord server. It has grown to a bit more than just that though as these things do.

I created this to learn how to use go to write a discord bot. I'll put it here in hopes that it helps someone else some day.

## Example config.json
```
{
    "Token":"YOUR.SECRET.TOKEN",
    "BotPrefix":"!"
}
```

Put the config.json in the same directory as your compiled binary.
